# uic Collectors Card

> This is a prompt for generating a futuristic trading card design for uic.

{
"prompt": "A futuristic trading card with a dark, moody neon aesthetic and soft sci-fi lighting. The card features a semi-transparent, rounded rectangle with slightly muted glowing edges, appearing as if made of chrome and glass. At the center is a large glowing hero logo of {{logo}}, with no additional text or label, it is completely transparent glass illuminated with a smooth gradient of {{colors}}, but not overly bright. The reflections on the card surface should be subtle, with a slight glossy finish catching ambient light. The background is a dark carbon fiber texture or deep gradient with soft ambient glows bleeding into the edges. Add subtle light rays streaming down diagonally from the top, giving the scene a soft cinematic glow. Apply light motion blur to the edges and reflections to give the scene a sense of depth and energy, as if it's part of a high-end tech animation still. Below the card, include realistic floor reflections that mirror the neon edges and logo—slightly diffused for a grounded, futuristic look. Text elements are minimal and softly lit: top-left shows '{{ticker}}', top-right has a stylized signature, and the bottom displays '{{company_name}}' with a serial number '{{card_number}}', a revenue badge reading '{{revenue}}', and the year '{{year}}'. Typography should have a faint glow with slight blurring, and all elements should feel premium, elegant, and softly illuminated—like a high-end cyberpunk collectible card.",

Additional Prompt Instructions:

A cinematic static shot of a futuristic trading card rotating very slowly in place. The card is identical on both sides. The background is dark with ambient neon glows and soft light rays streaming from above. The card is chrome, thick and premium, with beveled edges and subtle glossy reflections that react to the rotating motion. As the card turns, light dances across its surface, highlighting the glow of text and reflections of the transparent glass logo. The floor beneath the card shows a soft, diffused reflection. The rotation is smooth and continuous, completing a full 360-degree spin on the vertical axis, then seamlessly looping back to the start. No camera movement—only the card rotates, creating an elegant, endless loop.
